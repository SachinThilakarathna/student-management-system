      <Body bodyname="About">
        <p className="mx-30">I'm a 3rd year Software Engineering undergraduate student with a passion for coding and creating innovative solutions to complex problems. Throughout my studies, I've developed a solid foundation in programming languages such as Java, as well as web development technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. I also have a strong aptitude for UI/UX design and am proficient in using Figma, which allows me to create intuitive and user-friendly interfaces.
          <br></br><br></br>I've gained valuable experience working on projects both individually and as part of a team. Outside of software, I'm an avid cricket player, honing my leadership skills and team collaboration abilities. These experiences enrich my approach to software engineering, fostering effective teamwork and communication.
          In addition to my academic pursuits, I regularly attend online courses to learn new skills and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. I'm excited to connect with other professionals in the DevOps field and explore potential career opportunities.</p>
